# IOT-SET-CONFERENCE
 IOT conjointly certain the technologies like smart grids, intelligent transportation, smart homes, and smart cities once it deals with sensors. It’s discovered that usually the garbage get collected thanks to irregular removal of garbage gift within the dustbin. The garbage bins are going to be monitored by the system and informs regarding the amount of garbage collected within the garbage bins through an internet page. For this the system uses inaudible sensors placed over the bins to discover the level of garbage and compare it with the depth of garbage bins. GSM module is employed to communicate the data, which
is during this case the amount of garbage to the mobile wherever the most program is dead and passes onto the Arduino to perform
the various materials hooked up thereto via the bread board through the connecting wires.Conjointly so as for the data to be accessible from anyplace, this project’s integration with ThingSpeak is finished wherever a plot is created for Time against the amount of garbage.
