# IOT-SET-CONFERENCE
IOT conjointly certain the technologies like smart grids, intelligent transportation, smart homes, and smart cities once it deals with sensors.The garbage bins are going to be monitored by the system and informs regarding the amount of garbage collected within the garbage bins through an internet page. For this the system uses inaudible sensors placed over the bins to discover the level of garbage and compare it with the depth of garbage bins. GSM module is employed to communicate the data, which is during this case the amount of garbage to the mobile wherever the most program is dead and passes onto the Arduino to perform the various materials hooked up thereto via the bread board through the connecting wires.Conjointly so as for the data to be accessible from anyplace, this projectâ€™s integration with ThingSpeak is finished wherever a plot is created for Time against the amount of garbage.
 
Another feature added is its integration withthe Cloud online DB (Thing Speak) really brings out the smartness in implementing the project. The percentage of the garbage level is monitored and plotted on a graph with the API Key being specifically embedded into the code.

We have implementeda GPS tracker idea without actually using a GPS module. This code lets us know the location of the garbage and also helps us to determine the shortest distance b/w the garbage collector and the position of the garbage. This idea inhibits us from automatically knowing the location of the garbage, but has a procedure as follows. We have included buildings with each building having an ID. Whenever we enter the source ID of the garbage, it quickly gives us the shortest path from the location to any building, this helping the collector in moving faster to the location.
